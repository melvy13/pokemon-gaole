# About

<h4>A fun and simple Java console program that imitates the Pok√©mon Ga-Ol√© arcade game - Battle and Catch mode. üïπÔ∏è</h4>
<h4>This project is done in collaboration with:</h4>

</ul>

## How to Play

<p>The game starts off by asking you to first select a valid player ID in the resources/player.txt file. More players need to be added and initialised manually in the src/Game.java file (unfortunately).</p>
<p>As of today, there are only 6 player IDs to choose from (1-6). Each owns different Pok√©mon.</p>

![Starting Up](resources/starting.png)

<p>Pok√©mon Initially Owned:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Player 1: Greninja, Pikachu, Garchomp</li>
	<li>Player 2: Chimchar</li>
	<li>Player 3: None</li>
	<li>Player 4: Rowlet, Bayleef, Blastoise, Pikachu</li>
	<li>Player 5: Charmeleon, Luxray</li>
	<li>Player 6: Greninja, Infernape, Sandslash</li>
</ul>

<p>After choosing a player, the first game phase starts - Catch Time!</p>
<p>3 random Pok√©mon from the pool of 20 Pok√©mon (more to be hopefully added in the future) are chosen. Pick one Pok√©mon to add it into the owned Pok√©mon list!</p>

<p>Now you are ready for battle, the second game phase starts - Depart For Battle!</p>
<p>Two wild Pok√©mon will appear. Pick two Pok√©mon from your list of owned Pok√©mon to fight them!</p>

<p>Do not worry if you are poor (like me) and do not have enough Pok√©mon. A random Pok√©mon will be rented to you to fight them!</p>

![Depart For Battle!](resources/battle.png)

<p>Once you get your two Pok√©mon out, you will start to play RNG with the computer.</p>
<p>A random 'hidden number' from 1-100 will be generated. You have to enter a random number of your own from 1-100. The goal here is to get your number to be as close as possible to the hidden number!</p>

![RNG](resources/RNG.png)

<p>The computer itself will generate another number, and if this number is closer to the 'hidden number' than yours, the computer (the wild Pok√©mon) will attack first, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Whoever that attacks will have their two Pok√©mon attack the other two at the same time. The total damage done to each Pok√©mon is calculated using a formula based on type weaknesses and their individual stats.</p>

<p>Winning the RNG:</p>

<p>Losing the RNG:</p>

<p>If 2 of the wild Pok√©mon faints (0 HP), you win! You will then move on to the third game phase - Catch Pok√©mon!</p>

<p>If 2 of your Pok√©mon faints, you lose! You skip the third game phase and end the game with your results saved.</p>

![Losing the battle](resources/lostGame.png)

<p>Back to the Catch Pok√©mon! phase, you will get a random Pok√©ball (Pok√© Ball, Great Ball, Ultra Ball, or Master Ball) and you will be given a chance to catch one of the wild Pok√©mon.</p>
<p>The chance of the Pok√©mon being caught is also calculated by a formula based on the Pok√©mon level and the type of ball used. If you catch it successfully, you get to add it to your owned Pok√©mon list!</p>
<p>The game then ends with your results saved.</p>

![Catching Pok√©mon](resources/catch.png)

<p>What if the Pok√©mon escapes? You won't get the Pok√©mon, but you get Ga-Ol√© medals instead!</p>

<p>The amount of medals you get depends on the level of the Pok√©mon escaped. The higher the Pok√©mon level, the more your medals.</p>

![Ga-Ol√© Medals](resources/gaoleMedal.png)

<p>These medals can be accumulated, and when you reach a total of 160 Ga-Ol√© medals, it will be exchanged for a random boost item (Attack, Defense or Pokeball Power), which can be used when playing the next round!</p>

## Upcoming (hopefully)

<p>This program can definitely be further improved in the future. Maybe more Pok√©mon, better battling system, better players info saving.</p>
<p>We (probably) need moral support. Programming is not easy :(</p>
